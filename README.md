# ❤️ Heart Disease Predictor

## 📌 Overview

The **Heart Disease Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. Using classification algorithms, the model analyzes medical attributes (such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.) and provides predictions that can assist in **early diagnosis and preventive healthcare**.

The project is implemented in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and leverages popular **machine learning libraries** for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model persistence.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔹 Preprocessing and cleaning of health-related datasets
* 🔹 Training ML models for heart disease prediction
* 🔹 Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and metrics
* 🔹 Exporting trained models for reuse (`.pkl` or `.joblib`)
* 🔹 Interactive and easy-to-use workflow via Jupyter Notebook
